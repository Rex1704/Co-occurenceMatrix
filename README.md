# Co-occurrence Matrix Word Embeddings

This project implements **count-based word embeddings** using a **co-occurrence matrix**, followed by **dimensionality reduction (SVD)** and **visualization** of words in 2D space.  

Unlike prediction-based models (Word2Vec, GloVe), this approach relies on the **distributional hypothesis**:  
*"You shall know a word by the company it keeps."*
